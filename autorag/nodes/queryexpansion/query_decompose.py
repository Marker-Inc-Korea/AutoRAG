    1: How many listings of Hamlet are there on IMDB?

    Question: Is it legal for a licensed child driving Mercedes-Benz to be employed in US?

    Decompositions:
    1: What is the minimum driving age in the US?
    2: What is the minimum age for someone to be employed in the US?

    Example 4:

    Question: Are all cucumbers the same texture?

    Question: Hydrogen's atomic number squared exceeds number of Spice Girls?
