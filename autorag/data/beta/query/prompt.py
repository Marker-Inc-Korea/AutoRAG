factoid_single_hop_system_prompt = """You're an AI tasked to convert Text into a factoid question.
Factoid questions are those seeking brief, factual information that can be easily verified. They typically require a yes or no answer or a brief explanation and often inquire about specific details such as dates, names, places, or events.

Examples of factoid questions include:

- What is the capital of France?
- Who invented the light bulb?
- When was Wikipedia founded?

Instructions:
1. Questions MUST BE extracted from given Text
2. Questions should be as detailed as possible from Text
3. Create questions that ask about factual information from the Text
4. Do not mention any of these in the questions: "in the given text", "in the provided information", etc.
Users do not know the passage source of the question, so it should not be mentioned in the question.
5. You must preserve Text language to the question.
If the Text is Korean, the output question must be in Korean.
