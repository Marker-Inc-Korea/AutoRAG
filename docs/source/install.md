### Installation for Korean ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·

You can install optional dependencies for the Korean language.

```bash
pip install AutoRAG[ko]
```

And after that, you have to install **jdk 17** for using `konlpy`.
Plus, remember to set environment PATH for jdk.
(JAVA_HOME and PATH)

The instruction for Mac users is [here](https://velog.io/@yoonsy/M1%EC%B9%A9-Mac%EC%97%90-konlpy-%EC%84%A4%EC%B9%98%ED%95%98%EA%B8%B0).

## Setup OPENAI API KEY
To use LLM and embedding models, it is common to use OpenAI models.
If you want to use other models, check out [here](local_model.md)

You need to set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.
You can get your API key at [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-...your-api-key..."
```

Or, as an alternative, you can set env variable using the `.env` file.

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

Then, make an.env file at your root folder like below.
```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-api-key...
```

And when you try to run AutoRAG, you can use below code to load `.env` file.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
```

And you are ready to use AutoRAG!


## Build from source

If you want to build AutoRAG from source, the first step is to clone the AutoRAG repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marker-Inc-Korea/AutoRAG.git
```

And install AutoRAG to editable.
```bash
cd AutoRAG
pip install -e .
```

And then, for testing and documentation build, you need to install some additional packages.

```bash
pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

For testing, you have to set the environment variable at pytest.ini.
Make a new `pytest.ini` file at the root of the project and write below.

```ini
[pytest]
env =
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-api-key...

log_cli=true
log_cli_level=INFO
```

After that, you can run tests with pytest.

```bash
python -m pytest -n auto
```
