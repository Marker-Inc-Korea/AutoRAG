# Start creating your own evaluation data

## Overview
For the evaluation of RAGs we need data, but in most cases we have little or no satisfactory data.

However, since the advent of LLM, creating synthetic data has become one of the good solutions to this problem.

The following guide covers how to use LLM to create data in a form that AutoRAG can use.

AutoRAG aims to work with Python’s ‘primitive data types’ for scalability and convenience.

Therefore, to use AutoRAG, you need to convert your raw data into `corpus data`  and `qa data` to our [data format](./data_format.md).
