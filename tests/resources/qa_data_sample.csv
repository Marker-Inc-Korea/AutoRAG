1oy5tc,in football whats the point of wasting the first two plays with a rush - up the middle - not regular rush plays i get those,"[""Keep the defense honest, get a feel for the pass rush, open up the passing game. An offense that's too one dimensional will fail. And those rushes up the middle can be busted wide open sometimes for big yardage.""]",[['5b957791-3c7b-4f29-a410-8d005a538855']]

8v5e3s,Stars and Visibility,"[""It's a quirk of the human eye. At the center of the eye (the fovea) we mostly have colour-sensitive cone cells to see detail and colour of what we're focusing on. Around the fovea we mostly have rod cells that can't see colour but are more sensitive to variations in light intensity and movement.  \nLooking slightly to the side of the thing you're examining sends more of the light to the rod cells and lets you see things more clearly in low-light conditions where cones don't work well.""]",[['2ec51121-3640-43d7-85db-1259cddaa4c9']]

They are also more complicated, so that means reliability is going to be lower.  It is easier to operate, which may free up your attention for focus on what is *outside* the car.\n\nSome people derive satisfaction from shifting, and flexibility in using the power curve.']",[['6f20af70-48b7-4171-a8d7-967ea583a595']]
2reick,the special and general theory of relativity,"['We know that light moves at the speed *c* (roughly 300000km/s).\n\nSo here\'s a question for you (that Einstein asked himself): what would you see if you sat on a beam of light and looked into the mirror? Would your reflection disappear? Would it be normal?\n\nHe then thought: what\'s the speed of light relative to anyway?\n\nHere\'s the thing: if I run 10m/s, and I\'m on a train going at 100m/s, then when I run along the train I\'m running 10m/s relative to the train, and 110m/s relative to the tracks. So what is the speed of light relative to?\n\nIn his earlier career he did some experiments [EDIT: He didn\'t: it was Michelson and Morley, but Einstein knew about the results, and everything. Thanks /u/AramisAthosPorthos for pointing that out.]: can you tell which way the Earth is moving by looking at light inside a sealed box? If the speed of light is measured compared to something in the universe (which they called a luminiferous aether, IIRC) then you should be able to measure it, by seeing that the light hits one side of the box earlier, because the box is moving.\n\nBut there was no change, so Einstein realised that the speed of light isn\'t relative to anything. No matter what speed you\'re going at, you must always get the same speed of light.\n\nThis led to the special theory of relativity. He basically said ""what if time is variable and the speed of light is constant?"" and did all the maths to figure out what would happen. It\'s called ""special relativity"" because it only works in a special case: there is no mass (which causes forces) in it.\n\nGeneral relativity involved a lot more complicated maths to take into account the affects of gravity, which he modelled as a warping of space-time, and took some really, really hard maths to figure out. It\'s called general relativity because it can be applied to generally any situation. (Actually, it breaks down at quantum-mechanics levels, but that\'s a different story.)\n\nI think that covers the difference and where they came from. If you want any more details on them, feel free to ask and I\'ll see what I can get for you.']",[['dc5dc6d5-b53f-4a08-888d-2d6e5c85cf4b']]
6frazv,How do muscles grow?,"['I hope this answer qualifies as technical, yet simple enough (as I very rarely post here), but the basic idea that I understand is that your muscles rip and tear on a microscopic level when you are working out, and the harder you push those muscles, the more they rip. Hence where the idea comes from that more reps and less weight equal more tone, but more weight and less reps equal more muscle growth.\n\nWhat happens is that following those tiny rips and tears, your muscle heals over itself and essentially stacks on top of itself, healing bigger and stronger than before. The more those muscles are used, kept active and challenged, the more they will continue to build and grow over time.\n\nOther factors go into the growth of muscle as well, such as your nutrition. Protein, fats, etc. also play a factor, as they cause your body to ""feed"" your body and muscles in different ways of varying effectiveness - but I think that\'s an ELI5 for another day.']",[['7bdb7de8-6352-43e5-a494-d23545439df0']]

They sit in a studio and record their lines. The animators then animate the characters to match the recordings.\n\nThere are some cases (for example Andy Serkis as Gollum in the Lord of the Rings film series) where the voice actors also provides the motions of the character using motion capture technology.'],[['bfa4c77a-3399-4b6a-9f87-723928519798']]
