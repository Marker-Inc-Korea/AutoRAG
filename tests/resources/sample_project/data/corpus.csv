The top two teams with the best records in the regular season get a first round bye, and each of the bottom two division winners plays one of the two wild-card teams. Each winner of a wild-card game then plays one of the two bye teams. The winners of these two games go to the conference championships, and the winners of those conference championship games then face each other in the Super Bowl.

The score restored California's 14-point lead, making the game 49–35 with 6:26 remaining.
Needing to score quickly, Virginia Tech's subsequent drive consisted primarily of pass plays. Marcus Vick quarterbacked the first play of the drive, but his pass fell incomplete and he was replaced by Bryan Randall on subsequent plays. Randall completed his first three passes of the drive for 46 yards, pushing the Hokies into California territory. Kevin Jones picked up another first down on two rushes, then Randall completed a 28-yard pass to Chris Shreve for trouble have taken me, I have got no money to show

The song was produced by Willie Dixon and features Rush on guitar and vocal, Dixon on bass, Ike Turner on second guitar, Little Brother Montgomery on piano, Harold Ashby and Jackie Brenston on saxophones, and Billy Gayles on drums. Although Rush plays the lead guitar introduction to the song, Turner plays the signature vibrato guitar parts.  In 1986, Rush recorded a live version of the song for Blues Interaction – Live in Japan 1986, which was released two-point conversation. The Rush defense came up big and Chicago won, 55–47. Up next was the Colorado Crush, the defending ArenaBowl champions who had beaten the Rush twice in the regular season. But Chicago scored on an interception return for a touchdown by Dennison Robinson, Unertl recovered a ball off the net after a kickoff and DeJuan Alfonzo returned a fumble for a touchdown. The Rush led 13-0 after the first quarter, 33-14 at halftime and held on 63-46.
The San Jose SaberCats stood between the Rush and its first trip to the ArenaBowl. San Jose beat Chicago in the conference Rush.
Throughout his AFL career, Bonner completed 3,350 passes for 42,246 yards, and 855 touchdowns. He is also the winningest quarterback in league history, with 134 regular season victories and 21 playoff wins (as of April 2, 2007). He is widely considered one of the greatest players in AFL history. Coaching career Bonner began the 2011 AFL season as the offensive coordinator of the Chicago Rush after playing for Chicago in 2008. He called the plays and worked with quarterback Russ Michna. Broadcasting career After the Rush folded, Bonner turned his attention to broadcasting serving as both color analyst and sideline D'Orazio got the game. During the regular season, Chicago started the year at 0–2, but during the season, the Rush picked up defensive back Jeremy Unertl and offensive specialist Bobby Sippio. Both made huge impacts on their respective sides of the ball.
With a 5–9 record, the Rush won its last two games of the regular season to get a playoff spot.In the playoffs, the Rush managed to pull off key upsets. In the Wild Card Round, the Rush defeated the fourth-seeded Nashville Kats 55–47. In the Divisional Round, Chicago managed to pull off a huge upset by taking down the 40-yard rush to the Georgia Tech 19-yard line. Two plays later, Clemson quarterback Kyle Parker completed a 15-yard pass to Jacoby Ford. On the next play, Spiller ran forward three yards, across the goal line for a touchdown and the game's first points.
Clemson's post-score kickoff was returned to the Georgia Tech 15-yard line, where the Yellow Jackets began their first offensive possession. On the first two plays of the game, Georgia Tech running back Roddy Jones escaped the Clemson defense for gains of 21 yards and 22 yards, respectively. Those plays advanced the Yellow Jackets to the Clemson 42-yard line, San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) Internal Affairs Department Inspector (and undercover demon) Rodriguez pressuring the regular character Andy Trudeau.

In China, the most commonly found octane grade is RON 91 (regular), 93 (mid grade) and 97 (premium).  Almost all of the fuel has been unleaded since 2000.  In some premium gas stations in large cities, such as Petrol China and SinoPec, RON 98 gas is sold for racing cars.
In Europe, gasoline is unleaded and available in 95 RON (Eurosuper) and, in nearly all countries, 98 RON (Super Plus) octanes; in some countries 91 RON octane gasoline is offered option of different tiers of service at different prices. He was reported on CBC News as saying that he has always been in favour of allowing internet providers to charge differently for consumer access at different speeds. He said, ""Now, no doubt, my position might be wrong. Some friends in the network neutrality movement as well as some scholars believe it is wrong—that it doesn't go far enough. But the suggestion that the position is 'recent' is baseless. If I'm wrong, I've always been wrong."" Legislative reform Despite presenting an anti-regulatory standpoint in many fora, Lessig still sees the need and that it is one of the primary reasons for changing the subsidies system. Prices in neighboring countries In mid-November 2008, the prices super gasoline in the neighboring Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Turkey and the UAE were 105, 108, 74, 84, 187 and 45 cents per liter. Whereas, in Iran motorists are allowed 100 liters (26.4 US gallons) of gasoline each month at the subsidized price of about 10 cents per liter (37.9 cents per US gallons) and an unlimited amount at 40 cents per liter ($1.52 per US gallons). 
This means that the Iranian government is giving subsidy to cents per litre before the carton tax to ""117.9 cents on April 1, the first day of the new tax"" and 125.3 cents per litre in mid-July. There has been a 9.2 per cent drop in gasoline prices across Canada over the last year, according to the July 17, 2019 Statistics Canada report which resulted in inflation falling nationally in June 2019 to 2.0 per cent. DeHaan said that in July 2018 the average price of gas in Ontario had been 130.1 cents per litre. He added that the retail price of gas reflects the drop in the price of use their queuing time elsewhere in the park. The initial contract between Q-Bot developers Lo-Q was for 1 year from 8 April 2008. This contract was extended for 2009 before a new 3-year contract was signed on 26 March 2010. Three tiers of the device are available at different prices which reduce the queue time by different proportions. supported by the fixing of fuel prices well below market levels. There are two pricing schemes for petrol, one subsidized the other not. Each month, qualified vehicle owners are allocated a specific number of subsidized liters of petrol (taxi's have a significantly higher allocation). The cost of regular unsubsidized petrol in Iran is IR7,000/liter (approximately 37 US cents/liter) and premium grade petrol IR8,000/liter, whereas the subsidized equivalents go for IR4,000/liter and IR5,000/liter, respectively.

Iran has the world's second largest gas reserves, after Russia, but has been trying to develop its oil and gas resources for years, due to sanctions by the West.

'Super' is widely available at 97 RON (for example Shell V-Power, BP Ultimate). Leaded fuel is no longer available.
In the United States all motor vehicle gasoline is unleaded and is available in several grades with different octane rating; 87 (Regular), 89 (Mid-Grade), and 93 (Premium) are typical grades. At high altitudes in the Mountain States and the Black Hills of South Dakota, regular unleaded can be as low as 85 octane; this practice has become increasingly controversial, since it was instituted when most cars had carburetors instead of the fuel injection and electronic a bid-ask-based system.
The ask prices are immediate execution (market) prices for quick buyers (ask takers) while bid prices are for quick sellers (bid takers). If a trade is executed at quoted prices, closing the trade immediately without queuing would always cause a loss because the bid price is always less than the ask price at any point in time.  
The bid–ask spread is two sides of the same coin. The spread can be viewed as trading bonuses or costs according to different parties and different strategies. On one hand, traders who do NOT wish to queue their order, instead from about 3½ cents per gallon to about 4¾. By the middle of January, 1936, prices were above 5 cents.""

This period of 23 days applies in all likelihood solely to visibility during the day. Identity of Tianguan The asterisms (or ""constellations"") of Chinese astronomy were catalogued around the 2nd century BC. The asterisms with the brightest stars in the sky were compiled in a work called Shi Shi, which also includes Tianguan.

Naked eye Naked eye in astronomy The visibility of astronomical objects is strongly affected by light pollution. Even a few hundred kilometers away from a metropolitan area where the sky can appear to be very dark, it is still the residual light pollution that sets the limit on the visibility of faint objects. For most people, these are likely to be the best observing conditions within their reach. Under such ""typical"" dark sky conditions, the naked eye can see stars with an apparent magnitude up to +6ᵐ. Under perfect dark sky conditions where all light pollution is absent, stars as Limiting magnitude Naked eye visibility The limiting magnitude for naked eye visibility refers to the faintest stars that can be seen with the unaided eye near the zenith on clear moonless nights. The quantity is most often used as an overall indicator of sky brightness, in that light polluted and humid areas generally have brighter limiting magnitudes than remote desert or high altitude areas. The limiting magnitude will depend on the observer, and will increase with the eye's dark adaptation. On a relatively clear sky, the limiting visibility will be about 6th magnitude.
There is even variation within metropolitan areas. For viewing, 7 Days in Syria would be it.

Because of its form, each star always positions itself with its frontal side against the wind. The Kremlin stars are illuminated from the inside by filament lamps so that they could be seen against the sky. Even distribution of light inside the stars is ensured by the refractors, which consist of prismatic glass plates. The power of these lamps (3.7 kW in the stars of the Vodovzvodnaya and Borovitskaya towers and 5 kW in the remaining three) ensures good visibility of the stars day and night.

Final confirmation of the nature of R136a came after the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope. Its Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WFPC) resolved R136a into at least 12 components and showed that R136 contained over 200 highly luminous stars.  The more advanced WFPC2 allowed the study of 46 massive luminous stars within half a parsec of R136a and over 3,000 stars within a 4.7 parsec radius.

Stars have a dual relationship with publicity, for they publicize films but also, and importantly in the freelance market, have an interest in self publicity. It is for the latter reason that while many stars continue to regard managers as an optional luxury, today the majority of stars in Hollywood hire publicists to manage their media visibility. In other words, celebrities hire publicists who will be able to get their name out to the public preferably in a positive light.

"no drive applied to the wheels with the engine running
D = Drive - forward motion with full automatic operation in all gears.
All automatics use some sort of manual override of the transmission, with numbered positions in descending order marked below (or to the right) of ""Drive"", which will prevent the transmission shifting to a gear higher than the selected, but maintaining automatic operation between all lesser numbered gears.  Such gates will appear as ""P-R-N-D-3-2-1"" for example. On some vehicles (mainly Japanese makes such as Honda, Toyota and Lexus being good examples) these numbered positions are replaced by a single the flywheel, allowing it to start receiving power from the engine.
Manual transmissions are characterized by gear ratios that are selectable by locking selected gear pairs to the output shaft inside the transmission. Conversely, most automatic transmissions feature epicyclic (planetary) gearing controlled by brake bands and/or clutch packs to select gear ratio. Automatic transmissions that allow the driver to manually select the current gear are called manumatics. A manual-style transmission operated by computer is often called an automated transmission rather than an automatic, even though no distinction between the two terms need be made.
Contemporary automobile manual transmissions typically use four to selection of gear ratios. Many vehicles offer a 5-speed or 6-speed manual, whereas the automatic option would typically be a 4-speed. This is generally due to the increased space available inside a manual transmission compared with an automatic, since the latter requires extra components for self-shifting, such as torque converters and pumps. However, automatic transmissions are now adding more speeds as the technology matures. ZF currently manufactures 7- and 8-speed automatic transmissions. ZF is also planning a 9-speed automatic for use in front-wheel drive vehicles. The increased number of gears allows for better use of the engine's power band, resulting for vehicles equipped with the 7-speed automatic has been (numerically) reduced from 3.69 to 3.36, the new 7-speed automatic has much lower first through fourth gear overall ratios than the old 5-speed automatic and the 6-speed manual in the 6MT cars (which retain the old 3.69 final drive ratio). Giving it closer gear ratios in all gears, to match engine rpm better with power demand, brings better acceleration while overdrive ratios in 6th and 7th gears reduces highway cruising rpm and improves fuel mileage. The new 7-speed automatic retains the Drive Sport (DS) shift mode and Downshift Rev Matching (DRM) 2.7L HDi Ford AJD-V6/PSA DT17 which is used in a number of Ford, Peugeot, Citroen, Jaguar and Land Rover models.
From model years 1999 to 2002, the rear-wheel-drive S-Type was equipped with either a five-speed manual (Getrag 221) or a five-speed J-Gate Ford 5R55N transmission . From 2003, the S-Type was produced with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a six-speed J-Gate transmission that allows automatic gear selection or clutchless manual gear selection. The 2004 diesel saw the introduction of a 6-speed manual transmission; it was also available with the six-speed J-Gate automatic transmission. Reception The car was praised on its or an optional 4-speed automatic transmission.  Various gear sets and final drives were used between trims and model years, resulting here are 4 different manual transmission combinations:

In many jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, a driving licence issued for only vehicles with an automatic transmission is not valid for driving vehicles with a manual transmission, but a licence for manual transmissions covers both. This is also the case for P1 (provisional-1) car licence holders in New South Wales, Australia, but P2 (provisional-2) licence holders are allowed to drive vehicles with either transmission. Shifting speed Automatic transmissions can typically shift ratios faster than a manual gear change can be accomplished, due to the time required for the average driver to push the clutch pedal to the for an automatic gearbox compared to the United States. In some Asian markets and in Australia, automatic transmissions have become very popular since the 1980s.
Vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions are not as complex to drive. Consequently, in some jurisdictions, drivers who have passed their driving test in a vehicle with an automatic transmission will not be licensed to drive a manual transmission vehicle. Conversely, a manual license will allow the driver to drive vehicles with either an automatic or manual transmission. Countries in which such driving license restrictions are applied include some states in Australia, Austria, Botswana, Belgium, Belize, China, figures are also up as compared to previous variants 325 lb⋅ft (441 N⋅m) for manual transmission cars and 332 lb⋅ft (450 N⋅m) for cars with automatic transmission due to launch control and fast gear change ratios. This version is also the lightest and tips the scale at 1,258 kg (2,773 lb) for manual transmission cars and 1,310 kg (2,888 lb) for automatic transmission cars. The cars with automatic transmission weigh more due to the added weight of the gear box and its cooling system.

This is sometimes called a ""clutchless manual"", or ""automated manual"" transmission. Many of these transmissions allow the driver to fully delegate gear shifting choice to the control system, which then effectively acts as if it was a regular automatic transmission. They are generally designed using manual transmission ""internals"", and when used in passenger cars, have synchromesh operated helical constant mesh gear sets.

"out his research in special and general theory of relativity. At ICTP, he taught the advanced course of differential equations, Special functions, Upper and lower bounds on Entropy and the Number Theory. In 1988, after researching at ICTP under Abdus Salam, Qadir re-joined Qau and became full professor of Mathematics.
In 1989, Qadir published a book on Special relativity through World Scientific. Qadir provided simple representation of details of calculations and its extension into theory of motion. Through his text book, Qadir briefly discussed and introduced the Special Relativity for extension into General Relativity.
In 1993, he was asked by the President, Introduction to general relativity From special to general relativity In September 1905, Albert Einstein published his theory of special relativity, which reconciles Newton's laws of motion with electrodynamics (the interaction between objects with electric charge).  Special relativity introduced a new framework for all of physics by proposing new concepts of space and time.  Some then-accepted physical theories were inconsistent with that framework; a key example was Newton's theory of gravity, which describes the mutual attraction experienced by bodies due to their mass.
Several physicists, including Einstein, searched for a theory that would reconcile Newton's law of gravity and special moving bodies). In 1908, Hermann Minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime. Einstein adopted Minkowski's formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity. General relativity and the equivalence principle General relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction measuring a 21 km/sec gravitational redshift of 40 Eridani B.
The redshift of Sirius B was finally measured by Greenstein et al. in 1971, obtaining the value for the gravitational redshift of 89±19 km/sec, with more accurate measurements by the Hubble Space Telescope showing 80.4±4.8 km/sec. Tests of special relativity The general theory of relativity incorporates Einstein's special theory of relativity, and hence test of special relativity are also testing aspects of general relativity.  As a consequence of the equivalence principle, Lorentz invariance holds locally in non-rotating, freely falling reference frames. Experiments related to Lorentz invariance special relativity (that is, when gravitational effects Theory of relativity Development and acceptance Albert Einstein published the theory of special relativity in 1905, building on many theoretical results and empirical findings obtained by Albert A. Michelson, Hendrik Lorentz, Henri Poincaré and others. Max Planck, Hermann Minkowski and others did subsequent work.
Einstein developed general relativity between 1907 and 1915, with contributions by many others after 1915. The final form of general relativity was published in 1916.
The term ""theory of relativity"" was based on the expression ""relative theory"" (German: Relativtheorie) used in 1906 by Planck, who emphasized how the theory uses the principle of relativity. In the discussion section is known as space-velocity. He published his initial special relativistic version of the theory in 1997 in his book Cosmological Special Relativity: The Large-Scale Structure of Space, Time, and Velocity. He then developed the complete general relativistic theory called cosmological general relativity, publishing several papers on its implications over the next decade. Relativity: The Special and the General Theory Relativity: The Special and the General Theory began as a short paper and was eventually published as a book written by Albert Einstein with the aim of giving:
. . . an exact insight into the theory of relativity to those readers who, from a general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics.

It was first published in German in 1916 and later translated into English in 1920. It is divided into 3 parts, the first dealing pointedly credited Lorentz multiple times, while Lorentz credited Poincaré and Einstein, refusing to take credit for himself. He also downplayed the theory of general relativity, saying ""Einstein's general theory of relativity is only a theory of gravitation and of modifications in the laws of physics in gravitational fields"".  This would leave the special theory of relativity as the unique theory of relativity.   Keswani cited also  Vladimir Fock for this same opinion.
This series of articles prompted responses, among others from Herbert Dingle and Karl Popper.
Dingle said, among other things, "".. the 'principle of relativity' had various meanings, special theory of relativity was proposed by Einstein as an explanation for the seeming inconsistency between the constancy of the speed of light and the non-existence of a special, preferred or absolute frame of reference.
Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity could not easily be tested as it did not produce any effects observable on a terrestrial scale. However, as one of the first tests of general relativity, the theory predicted that large masses such as stars would bend light, in contradiction to accepted theory; this was observed in a 1919 eclipse. Finance Mathematical models of stock market behaviour (and economic that has such a formulation.
Albert Einstein proposed this principle for his special theory of relativity; however, that theory was limited to space-time coordinate systems related to each other by uniform inertial motion. Einstein recognized that the general principle of relativity should also apply to accelerated relative motions, and he used the newly developed tool of tensor calculus to extend the special theory's global Lorentz covariance (applying only to inertial frames) to the more general local Lorentz covariance (which applies to all frames), eventually producing his general theory of relativity. The local reduction of the metric tensor to the Minkowski metric ",dc5dc6d5-b53f-4a08-888d-2d6e5c85cf4b,2024-01-13 14:03:16.791124,{}
"two to three days later. Once thought to be caused by lactic acid build-up, a more recent theory is that it is caused by tiny tears in the muscle fibers caused by eccentric contraction, or unaccustomed training levels. Since lactic acid disperses fairly rapidly, it could not explain pain experienced days after exercise. Hypertrophy Independent of strength and performance measures, muscles can be induced to grow larger by a number of factors, including hormone signaling, developmental factors, strength training, and disease.  Contrary to popular belief, the number of muscle fibres cannot be increased through exercise.  Instead, muscles grow organs from eye muscles when they are 12–15 mm (0.5–0.6 in). After this they swim to the bottom and grow into adults. Taxonomy The northern stargazer was first described by Charles Conrad Abbott in 1860. the bay. These eggs float to the surface after they are released. They hatch into larvae and grow up to 6–7 mm (0.24–0.28 in). They slowly become dark in color and develop the electrical organs from eye muscles when they are 12–15 mm (0.5–0.6 in). After this they swim to the bottom and grow into adults. injection treatment.
Some forms of strabismus can be corrected by weakening an extraocular muscle. Botulinum toxin blocks the neuromuscular transmission and thus paralyzes injected muscles. Paralysis is temporary, and it might seem that injections would always need to be repeated, except that muscles adapt to the lengths at which they are chronically held, so that a paralyzed muscle tends to get stretched-out by its antagonist and grows longer by addition of serial sarcomeres (the contractile units of skeletal muscles), while the antagonist tends to grow shorter by deletion of sarcomeres, thereby maintaining re-alignment when the toxin-caused paralysis has resolved.

She has the power to make her muscles grow, telepathy, and is shown to be immune to Superboy's telekinetic powers. length are also unique to the worm and help with identification as it can grow up to 300 millimetres (12 in) and can get a diameter of 10 millimetres (0.4 in). The New Zealand Earthworm has clitella on 14-19th segments, which can extend and overlap onto the 13 and 20th segments (Lee 1959). The New Zealand Earthworm has strong muscles in the anterior and posterior for burrowing but a weak body. The majority of the earthworm’s muscles are present in the anterior and the posterior of the body (head and anus) as this allows for optimum burrowing ability. This helps with the either be attached to the wall of the coelom or may float about in it freely. The coelom allows muscles to grow independently of the body wall — this feature can be seen in the digestive tract of tardigrades (water bears) which is suspended within the body in the mesentery derived from a mesoderm-lined coelom. Coelomic fluid The fluid inside the coelom is known as coelomic fluid. This is circulated by mesothelial cilia or by contraction of muscles in the body wall which are themselves of mesin. The coelomic fluid serves several functions: it acts as a hydroskeleton; it allows gait.
The body's posture changes as the pregnancy progresses. The pelvis tilts and the back arches to help keep balance. Poor posture occurs naturally from the stretching of the woman's abdominal muscles as the fetus grows. These muscles are less able to contract and keep the lower back in proper alignment. The pregnant woman has a different pattern of gait. The step lengthens as the pregnancy progresses, due to weight gain and changes in posture. On average, a woman's foot can grow by a half size or more during pregnancy. In addition, the increased body weight of pregnancy, fluid retention, and supported by the Greek physician Galen, held that nerves were hollow and the movement of spirits through them propelled muscle motion. René Descartes furthered the idea by basing it on a model of hydraulics, suggesting that the spirits were analogous to fluids or gasses and calling them 'animal spirits'. In the model, which Descartes used to explain reflexes, the spirits would flow from the ventricles of the brain, through the nerves, and to the muscles to animate the latter. According to this hypothesis, muscles would grow larger when they contract because of the animal spirits flowing into them.  To In contrast, Type II males do not build nests or attract females on their own. Instead, they sneak up to the Type I's nests and deposit their eggs. These behavioral differences can be seen in the differences in the structure and function of the nervous system. Neurons and Muscles Type I males and Type II males and females grow along different growth paths when it comes to neurons and muscles that determine morph-specific vocal behavior. For Type I males, for example, sexual maturation is preceded by growth of the mate-calling circuit and sonic muscle.

"it is by [Aslan] that he has truly sworn, though he know it not, and it is I who reward him""), ratifying the good deeds the latter did even in service to a false god, have been the subject of controversy because they implicitly endorse inclusivism. Film portrayals In the 2005 film, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the CGI Aslan is voiced by Liam Neeson. Neeson returned to voice the character in the sequel, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian in 2008, and the third film in the series, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Emmy award for Outstanding Animated Program that year. It was the first feature-length animated film ever made for television. For its release on British television, many of the characters' voices were re-recorded by British actors and actresses (including Leo McKern, Arthur Lowe and Sheila Hancock), but Stephen Thorne was the voice of ""Aslan"" in both the U.S. and British versions.
From 1988–90, parts of The Chronicles of Narnia were turned into four successful BBC television serials, The Chronicles of Narnia, based on the first four of the seven books. All four were shown on the PBS show WonderWorks and they were was a huge box-office hit, grossing $475 million worldwide. Neeson also starred in Atom Egoyan's erotic thriller Chloe, theatrically released by Sony Pictures Classics on 26 March 2010. Chloe had enjoyed commercial success and became the Canadian director's biggest money maker ever. Later the same year, he played John ""Hannibal"" Smith in the spin-off movie from the television series The A-Team. Neeson continued to voice Aslan in the sequel The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (2010).
In 2011, Neeson starred in the action-thriller Unknown, a German-British-American co-production of a French book filmed in Berlin in early 2010, and Noel Fielding, Matt Berry, Micky Flanagan, Jack Whitehall, John Oliver.
Also appearing were actors Tim Roth and Liam Neeson.  Neeson introduced a short presentation by formerly imprisoned Burmese comedian and political activist Zarganar.  There was a cameo appearance by Richard Branson in one skit.   There were music sets, each of three songs, by Mumford & Sons and Coldplay.  There were real-time comedic commentaries on the show from Statler and Waldorf of the Muppets and from Beavis and Butt-head in animated sequences.  Monty Python alumni Michael Palin, Eric Idle, and Terry Jones appeared in pre-recorded video off the idea of actually travelling to Europe. Taken brought Neeson back into the center of the public eye and resulted in his being cast in many more big-budget Hollywood movies. That year he also narrated the documentary Black Holes: The Other Side of Infinity and again lent his voice to Aslan in The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008). He also provided a voice for Hayao Miyazaki's anime film Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea, which received an August 2009 release.
In 2010, Neeson played Zeus in the remake of the 1981 film, Clash of the Titans. The film Father Bernard in Neil Jordan's adaptation of Patrick McCabe's novel Breakfast on Pluto. In The Simpsons episode ""The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star"" (2005), he voiced the kindly priest who (briefly) converts Bart and Homer to Catholicism. That same year, he gave his voice to the lion Aslan in the blockbuster fantasy film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. In 2007, he starred in the American Civil War epic Seraphim Falls.
Neeson voiced the main character's father, James, in the video game Fallout 3. Executive producer Todd Howard said, ""This role was written in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe 40 years later. The Last Battle (1956) Completed in March 1953 and published 4 September 1956, The Last Battle chronicles the end of the world of Narnia. Jill and Eustace return to save Narnia from the ape Shift, who tricks Puzzle the donkey into impersonating the lion Aslan, thereby precipitating a showdown between the Calormenes and King Tirian. This leads to the end of Narnia as it is known throughout the series, but allows Aslan to lead the characters to the ""true"" Narnia. Aslan Aslan, the Great Lion, is the eponymous lion Aslan (fanzine) Aslan was a highly regarded British role-playing game fanzine that was published in Brighton and subsequently York in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It ran for 13 issues and many of them had sub-zines included. The title refers to both a character in The Chronicles of Narnia and an alien race in the Traveller role-playing game. The fanzine grew out of a long-running fantasy role-playing game which took place at the University of Sussex. The editor and publisher was Andrew Rilstone, who was initially assisted by Martin Wykes.
Aslan became known for its RPG theory, philosophy, speculation and is what I have dreamed about playing, you wait your whole life for an opportunity like this and when it comes you have to grab it.""
The following year, Nesbitt co-starred with Liam Neeson in the fact-based television film Five Minutes of Heaven (Oliver Hirschbiegel, 2009). The first part of the film dramatises the real-life murder of Jim Griffin by Alistair Little in 1970s Lurgan; the second part features a fictional meeting between Little (Neeson) and Jim's brother Joe (Nesbitt) 33 years later. Nesbitt met with Griffin before filming began to learn about how his brother's murder affected him. The film Kinsey, a movie about the life of Alfred Kinsey, played by Liam Neeson. Kinsey was Sarsgaard's first film role which featured full frontal nudity. Paul Clinton of CNN reported that Sarsgaard's Clyde Martin ""stands out"" and ""confirms that he's without doubt one of the best character actors of his generation."" When asked about his kissing scenes with Neeson in Kinsey, Sarsgaard said:
It wasn't as hard as, say, running around with all my gear on in Jarhead. I'd rather go for an awkward moment than physical exertion any day. The only thing that I think [male actors] get freaked out about ",bfa4c77a-3399-4b6a-9f87-723928519798,2024-01-13 14:03:16.791132,{}
"was that I was able to sit by myself and play and dream. And I was always happy doing that. I used to go off in the bathroom, because the bathroom had tiles, so it was a slight echo chamber. I'd turn on the faucet so that water would run – I like that sound, it's very soothing to me – and I'd play. In the dark. 'Hello darkness, my old friend / I've come to talk with you again.
""Weird Al"" Yankovic in fact in 1979 recorded his first single, ""My Bologna,"" in the bathroom across from the California Polytechnic if its wavelength exceeded its circumference, which is indeed π times its diameter. Water dripping from a faucet/tap A special case of this is the formation of small droplets when water is dripping from a faucet/tap.  When a segment of water begins to separate from the faucet, a neck is formed and then stretched. If the diameter of the faucet is big enough, the neck doesn't get sucked back in, and it undergoes a Plateau–Rayleigh instability and collapses into a small droplet. Urination Another everyday example of Plateau–Rayleigh instability occurs in urination, particularly standing male urination. The stream of Gooseneck (piping) A gooseneck (or goose neck) is a 180° pipe fitting at the top of a vertical pipe that prevents entry of water. Common implementations of goosenecks are ventilator piping or ducting for bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans, ship holds, landfill methane vent pipes, or any other piping implementation exposed to the weather where water ingress would be undesired. It is so named because the word comes from the similarity of pipe fitting to the bend in a goose's neck.
Gooseneck may also refer to a style of kitchen or bathroom faucet with a long vertical pipe terminating in a pumps, dug wells, aside from few places with faucet potable water system.
Per 2006 Barangay Profile Survey on sources of potable water supply, the following result revealed that out of the total number of households, only about 513 or 5.98% are dependent on owned-use faucet system of potable water, where households get water supply from a faucet inside the house/yard directly connected to a water pipeline from their own water system (electric pump).
There are 2,299 households or 26.80% that take their drinking water from a tube/pipe well (jetmatic/pitcher pump) for private use of the household, 637 household or 11.87 takes their Air gap (plumbing) An air gap, as it relates to the plumbing trade, is the unobstructed vertical space between the water outlet and the flood level of a fixture. Air gaps of appropriate design are required for water safety by legislation in many countries.
A simple example is the space between a wall mounted faucet and the sink rim (this space is the air gap).  Water can easily flow from the faucet into the sink, but there is no way that water can flow from the sink into the faucet without modifying the system. This arrangement will prevent any contaminants Automatic faucet An automatic faucet or tap (also hands-free faucet, touchless faucet, electronic faucet, motion sensing faucet, sensor faucet, or infrared faucet) is a faucet equipped with a proximity sensor and mechanism that opens its valve to allow water to flow in response to the presence of a hand or hands in close proximity. The faucet closes its valve again after a few seconds or when it no longer detects the presence of hands. Most automatic faucets are battery powered and incorporate an active infrared sensor to detect hand motion. Uses Automatic faucets are common in public washrooms, particularly in buoyancy forces and the momentum of the wind. Usage The Froude number is used to compare the wave making resistance between bodies of various sizes and shapes.
In free-surface flow, the nature of the flow (supercritical or subcritical) depends upon whether the Froude number is greater than or less than unity.
One can easily see the line of ""critical"" flow in a kitchen or bathroom sink. Leave it unplugged and let the faucet run. Near the place where the stream of water hits the sink, the flow is supercritical. It 'hugs' the surface and moves quickly. On the outer edge of the Simmons, the Assistant County Physician, to an upstairs bathroom where Ocey's naked body was sitting in a tub of water with her head tilted under the faucet.
A suicide note pinned to her clothes was beside the bathtub. It read as follows:
Last year my little daughter died. Other near and dear kindred too have gone to Heaven. I long to go there too. I have been ill and weak a very long time now. Death will be a blessed relief to me in my sufferings. When you read this I will have committed suicide. My sorrow and pain in this world Faucet aerator A faucet aerator (or tap aerator) is often found at the tip of modern indoor water faucets.  Aerators can be simply screwed onto the faucet head, creating a non-splashing stream and often delivering a mixture of water and air. Prevents splashing When a single stream of water hits a surface the water must go somewhere, and because the stream is uniform the water will tend to go mostly in the same direction. If a single stream hits a surface which is curved, then the stream will conform to the shape and be easily redirected with the force water used by a standard household. Other benefits of automatic faucets are found in inhibiting the spread of germs which are known to thrive on faucet handles, as well as help prevent or mitigate scalding incidents caused by hot water flowing out of the faucet. Advantages Automatic faucets have the advantage of shutting off automatically after hand washing, thereby reducing water waste. When installed in a home, sensor faucets alleviate the need for parents to ensure that children have turned off the faucet. They can also benefit the elderly and those suffering from arthritis or other mobility limiting conditions since ",69a07e70-1767-468e-9eb1-010e8b0f61d0,2024-01-13 14:03:16.791136,{}
"titration based in a neutralization reaction but it can also be a precipitation or a complex forming reaction as well as a titration based in a redox reaction. However, each method in quantitative analysis has a general specification, in neutralization reactions, for example, the reaction that occurs is between an acid and a base, which yields a salt and water, hence the name neutralization. In the precipitation reactions the standard solution is in the most cases silver nitrate which is used as a reagent to react with the ions present in the sample and to form a highly insoluble precipitate. formed from a series of pH controlled precipitation reactions (it is important to note these reactions can be carried out with or without the presence of molybdenum depending on the desired final phase). It is also possible to start with the parent oxides (Bi₂O₃ and V₂O₅) and perform a high temperature calcination to achieve a pure product. resulting complex can be predicted with the crystal field theory and ligand field theory. Complexation reactions also include ligand exchange, in which one or more ligands are replaced by another, and redox processes which change the oxidation state of the central metal atom. Precipitation Precipitation is the formation of a solid in a solution or inside another solid during a chemical reaction. It usually takes place when the concentration of dissolved ions exceeds the solubility limit and forms an insoluble salt. This process can be assisted by adding a precipitating agent or by removal of the solvent. Rapid precipitation results environmental soil chemistry is paramount to predicting the fate of contaminants, as well as the processes by which they are initially released into the soil. Once a chemical is exposed to the soil environment myriad chemical reactions can occur that may increase or decrease contaminant toxicity. These reactions include adsorption/desorption, precipitation, polymerization, dissolution, complexation and oxidation/reduction. These reactions are often disregarded by scientists and engineers involved with environmental remediation. Understanding these processes enable us to better predict the fate and toxicity of contaminants and provide the knowledge to develop scientifically correct, and cost-effective remediation strategies. Cadmium nitrate Uses Cadmium nitrate is used for coloring glass and porcelain and as a flash powder in photography. Reactions Thermal dissociation at elevated temperatures produces cadmium oxide and oxides of nitrogen.  When hydrogen sulfide is passed through an acidified solution of cadmium nitrate, yellow cadmium sulfide is formed.  A red modification of the sulfide is formed under boiling conditions.
When with caustic soda solution, cadmium oxide forms precipitate of cadmium hydroxide.  Many insoluble cadmium salts are obtained by such precipitation reactions. bicarbamate at an operating range of 0.31-0.41 mol CO₂/equiv PZ, enhancing the rate of overall CO₂ absorbed under operating conditions (refer to Figure 1 below). Due to these reactions, there is limited free piperazine present in the solvent, resulting in its low volatility and rates of precipitation as PZ-6H₂O. concentration before the valuable metal is recovered either in its metallic state or as a chemical compound. This may include precipitation, distillation, adsorption, and solvent extraction. The final recovery step may involve precipitation, cementation, or an electrometallurgical process. Sometimes, hydrometallurgical processes may be carried out directly on the ore material without any pretreatment steps. More often, the ore must be pretreated by various mineral processing steps, and sometimes by pyrometallurgical processes. Pyrometallurgy Pyrometallurgy involves high temperature processes where chemical reactions take place among gases, solids, and molten materials.  Solids containing valuable metals are treated to form intermediate compounds for mustard plants soak up selenium well. Permeable reactive barriers Certain types of permeable reactive barriers utilize biological organisms in order to remediate groundwater. Chemical precipitation Chemical precipitation is commonly used in wastewater treatment to remove hardness and heavy metals. In general, the process involves addition of agent to an aqueous waste stream in a stirred reaction vessel, either batchwise or with steady flow. Most metals can be converted to insoluble compounds by chemical reactions between the agent and the dissolved metal ions. The insoluble compounds (precipitates) are removed by settling and/or filtering. Ion exchange Ion exchange for ground water remediation at the top of the tube.
After some hours, the continuous region of precipitation is followed by a clear region with no sensible precipitate, followed by a short region of precipitate further down the tube. This process continues down the tube forming several, up to perhaps a couple dozen, alternating regions of clear gel and precipitate rings. Some general observations Over the decades huge number of precipitation reactions have been used to study the phenomenon, and it seems quite general.  Chromates, metal hydroxides, carbonates, and sulfides, formed with lead, copper, silver, mercury and cobalt salts are sometimes favored by investigators, barrier materials or precipitation from the dissolved state. Organic compounds tend to be undergo sorption due to hydrophobic expulsion from the surrounding water. Metals, however, tend to sorb through electrostatic attraction or surface complexation reactions. Sorption and precipitation are potentially reversible and may thus require removal of the reactive medium and gathered products in order to continue with remediation. Transformation Transformation involves taking the contaminant and transforming it to a less harmful or non-toxic form. One of the chief benefits of transformation is that it does not necessarily require removal of the reactive medium (unless the reactive medium must be ",db002019-53da-4968-a28f-10a5a7cfbf31,2024-01-13 14:03:16.791140,{}
"D which penetrates the skin helps the body to absorb more calcium which is essential for building and maintaining bones, especially for developing embryos. Vitamin D production depends on exposure to sunlight. Humans living at latitudes far from the equator developed light skin in order to help absorb more vitamin D. People with light (type II) skin can produce previtamin D3 in their skin at rates 5–10 times faster than dark-skinned (type V) people. People living far from the equator were under evolutionary pressure to develop light skin, which allowed more penetration of UV radiation and helped to produce more found to be more prevalent in certain population than others. Health implications Skin pigmentation is an evolutionary adaptation to the various UV radiation levels around the world. There are health implications of light-skinned people living in environments of high UV radiation. Various cultural practices increase problems related to health conditions of light skin, for example sunbathing among the light-skinned. Advantages of light skin pigmentation in low sunlight environments Humans with light skin pigmentation living in low sunlight environments experience increased vitamin D synthesis compared to humans with dark skin pigmentation due to the ability to absorb more sunlight. Almost every Dark skin Dark skin is the human skin color that is rich in melanin pigments, especially eumelanin. People with very dark skin are often referred to as ""black people"", although this usage can be ambiguous in some countries where it is also used to specifically refer to different ethnic groups or populations. 
The evolution of dark skin is believed to have begun around 1.2 million years ago, in light-skinned early hominid species after they moved from the equatorial rainforest to the sunny savannas. In the heat of the savannas, better cooling mechanisms were required, which were achieved through the loss characteristic of dark skin. Melanosomes are not in aggregated state in darkly pigmented skin compared to lightly pigmented skin. Due to the heavily melanised melanosomes in darkly pigmented skin, it can absorb more energy from UVR and thus offers better protection against sunburns and by absorption and dispersion UV rays. Darkly pigmented skin protects against direct and indirect DNA damage. Photodegration occurs when melanin absorbs photons. Recent research suggest that the photoprotective effect of dark skin is increased by the fact that melanin can capture free radicals, such as hydrogen peroxide, which are created by the interaction of UVR and layers of the skin. Heavily pigmented melanocytes have greater capacity to divide after UVR irradiation, which suggests that they receive less damage to their DNA. Despite this, UVB damages the immune system even in darker skinned individuals due to its effect on Langerhans cells. The stratum corneum of people with dark or heavily tanned skin is more condensed and contains more cornified cell layers than in lightly pigmented humans. These qualities of dark skin enhance the barrier protection function of the skin.
Although darkly pigmented skin absorbs about 30 to 40% more sunlight than lightly pigmented skin, dark skin does not The presence of pheomelanin in light skin increases the oxidative stress in melanocytes, and this combined with the limited ability of pheomelanin to absorb UVR contributes to higher skin cancer rates among light-skinned individuals. The damaging effect of UVR on DNA structure and the entailing elevated skin cancer risk is widely recognized. However, these cancer types usually affect people at the end or after their reproductive career and could have not been the evolutionary reason behind the development of dark skin pigmentation. Of all the major skin cancer types, only malignant melanoma have a major effect in a person's reproductive with age. However, when an optician examines the eye by shining a light from the side of the eye, the light shines back through the iris since very little pigment is present.""
Because individuals with albinism have skin that entirely lacks the dark pigment melanin, which helps protect the skin from the sun's ultraviolet radiation, their skin can burn more easily from overexposure.
The human eye normally produces enough pigment to color the iris blue, green or brown and lend opacity to the eye. In photographs, those with albinism are more likely to demonstrate ""red eye"", due to the red of the other main hypotheses that have been put forward to explain the development of light skin pigmentation: resistance to cold injury, and occurrence of a mutation effect; now both of them are considered unlikely to be the main mechanism behind the evolution of light skin.
The resistance to cold injury hypothesis claimed that dark skin was selected against in cold climates far from the equator and in higher altitudes as dark skin was more affected by frostbite. It has been found that reaction of the skin to extreme cold climates has actually more to do with other aspects, such as the distribution the reliefs received a coating, which acted as a surface for painting. This could be white paint or grey-yellow paint in Augustan times but it could also be stucco. 
At present, no canonical, prescribed use of colours can be detected, except that at least from Augustan times the background was usually in light blue regardless of the scenes and motifs, but it could include two or more other colours as well. The colour of human skin was usually in something between dark red and hot pink. In Dionysiac scenes, skin could also be painted a reddy-brown. In Augustan times light present in medieval Europe. For example, Roy Greenhilt and his family have dark brown skin, and are not referred to as coming from a different area or having a different cultural background than the characters with light skin. Other characters, such as the lawyer Phil Rodriguez, show a third (light brown) skin color. Non-human races, which are often player characters in D&D, such as dwarves and gnomes, have both dark- and light-skinned members as well.

"in Europe: urbanization had increased crowding, making it easier for the disease to spread; yet effective protection from smallpox through a smallpox vaccine was discovered only at the end of the century (see below).
The disease was a terrible one for its victims. Ian and Jenifer Glynn write:
So what was it like? As children, we were told it was like chickenpox but worse. In fact it is not related to chickenpox, and it was unimaginably worse. In an unvaccinated population, something like 10–30 percent of all patients with smallpox would be expected to die. And dying was not easy; smallpox was, childhood, or after a latency period of many years. Shingles After a chickenpox infection, the virus remains dormant in the body's nerve tissues. The immune system keeps the virus at bay, but later in life, usually in an adult, it can be reactivated and cause a different form of the viral infection called shingles (also known as herpes zoster).
The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) suggests that every adult over the age of 50 years get the herpes zoster vaccine.
Shingles affects one in five adults infected with chickenpox as children, especially those who are immune-suppressed, particularly from cancer, to one month.
Chickenpox is rarely fatal, although it is generally more severe in adult men than in women or children. Non-immune pregnant women and those with a suppressed immune system are at highest risk of serious complications. Arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) associated with chickenpox in the previous year accounts for nearly one third of childhood AIS. The most common late complication of chickenpox is shingles (herpes zoster), caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus decades after the initial, often childhood, chickenpox infection. Pathophysiology Exposure to VZV in a healthy child initiates the production of host immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin Poison Ivy (song) Lyrics The song discusses a girl known as ""Poison Ivy"". She is compared to measles, mumps, chickenpox, the common cold, and whooping cough, but is deemed worse, because ""Poison Ivy, Lord, will make you itch"". According to lyricist Jerry Leiber, ""Pure and simple, 'Poison Ivy' is a metaphor for a sexually transmitted disease"". The song also makes references to other flowers such as a rose and a daisy. major clinical syndromes have been described: febrile purpura, malignant chickenpox with purpura, postinfectious purpura, purpura fulminans, and anaphylactoid purpura. These syndromes have variable courses, with febrile purpura being the most benign of the syndromes and having an uncomplicated outcome. In contrast, malignant chickenpox with purpura is a grave clinical condition that has a mortality rate of greater than 70%. The cause of these hemorrhagic chickenpox syndromes is not known. Epidemiology Primary varicella occurs in all countries worldwide. In 2015 chickenpox resulted in 6,400 deaths globally – down from 8,900 in 1990. There were 7,000 deaths in 2013.
In temperate countries, chickenpox the vaccine is only recommended in people who are particularly vulnerable to chickenpox. The National Health Service cites concerns about unvaccinated children catching chickenpox as adults when it is more dangerous, an increased risk of shingles in adults due to the lack of contact with chickenpox-infected children providing a natural boosting to immunity, and the fact that chickenpox is usually a mild illness. Contraindications The varicella vaccine is not recommended for seriously ill people, pregnant women, people who have tuberculosis, people who have experienced a serious allergic reaction to the varicella vaccine in the past, people who are allergic to as two intramuscular doses, two to six months apart.
A herpes-zoster subunit (HZ-su) vaccine has shown to be immunogenic and safe in adults with human immunodeficiency virus. History Chickenpox-like rashes were recognised and described by ancient civilizations;  the relationship between zoster and chickenpox was not realized until 1888.
It was in 1943 that Ruska noticed the similarity between virus particles isolated from the lesions of zoster and those from chickenpox.
In 1974 the first vaccine was introduced for chickenpox. increased as adults are less exposed to infected children (which would otherwise help protect against shingles). Ten years after the vaccine was recommended in the US, the CDC reported as much as a 90% drop in chickenpox cases, a varicella-related hospital admission decline of 71% and a 97% drop in chickenpox deaths among those under 20.
Vaccines are less effective among high-risk patients, as well as being more dangerous because they contain attenuated live virus. In a study performed on children with an impaired immune system, 30% had lost the antibody after five years, and 8% had already caught wild chickenpox strep.
These serious complications (i.e. they can cause brain damage or death) are vastly more likely than adverse vaccine events. Before the chickenpox vaccine became available 100 to 150 children in the U.S. died from chickenpox annually. The chickenpox vaccine is recommended by health officials as safer than infection by any means.
Some parents have attempted to collect infected material, such as saliva, licked lollipops, or other infected items from people who claim to have children infected with chickenpox. The parents use social networking services to make contact with these strangers. The unknown person then mails the potentially infectious matter to the the virus after vaccine tend to experience milder cases of chickenpox.
Catching ""wild"" chickenpox as a child has been thought to commonly result in lifelong immunity. Indeed, parents have deliberately ensured this in the past with ""pox parties"". Historically, exposure of adults to contagious children has boosted their immunity, reducing the risk of shingles. The CDC and corresponding national organizations are carefully observing the failure rate which may be high compared with other modern vaccines—large outbreaks of chickenpox having occurred at schools which required their children to be vaccinated. Chickenpox Prior to the introduction of the vaccine in 1995 in the ",fbb8e444-b487-4ba7-9d0b-75b243fd666b,2024-01-13 14:03:16.791153,{}
"CD. There is also a hybrid HD DVD format which contains both DVD and HD DVD versions of the same movie on a single disc, providing a smooth transition for the studios in terms of publishing movies, and allowing consumers with only DVD players to still use the discs. DVD replication companies can continue using their current production equipment with only minor alterations when changing over to the format of HD DVD replication. Due to the structure of the single-lens optical head, both red and blue laser diodes can be used in smaller, more compact HD DVD players.

Home media The Angry Birds Movie 2 will be released on digital and Movies Anywhere by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on October 29, 2019, with Blu-ray, Ultra HD Blu-ray, and DVD releases following on November 12. All releases will include an animated short film entitled Live Stream. The Ultra HD Blu-ray version will be the first release of its kind to be IMAX enhanced. Box office As of October 22, 2019, The Angry Birds Movie 2 has grossed $41.5 million in the United States and Canada, among other reasons. Toshiba ended production of their HD DVD players and discontinued promotion of the format, while the HD DVD movie release schedule concluded by June 2008.
After HD DVD was discontinued, Blu-ray became the de facto high-definition optical disc format. However, sales figures suggest that DVD is in no immediate danger of disappearing. All standard DVDs will play on existing Blu-ray players, making the switch to Blu-ray much easier than the switch from VHS to DVD. Moreover, some labels are cutting back on Blu-ray Disc releases in favor of DVD-Video, claiming that low sales do not justify the more 2007 (three weeks after airing on Sky One). The DVD releases feature an extended cut of the movie and include extras such as the seven ""webisodes"" that were created to be screened online in the weeks prior to the movie's broadcast. The Region 1 DVD also has a featurette with cast members discussing their favorite episodes. Razor was released on Region 4 DVD on August 20, 2008, before its Ten HD broadcast premiere on September 4, 2008.
SciFi.com allowed fans to choose the cover art for the DVD release, and the winning cover was announced on September 14, 2007.  In the original design of the January 2007, Blu-ray Discs had outsold HD DVDs, and during the first three quarters of 2007, BD outsold HD DVD by about two to one. At CES 2007, Warner proposed Total Hi Def—a hybrid disc containing Blu-ray on one side and HD DVD on the other, but it was never released.
In a June 28, 2007, press release, Twentieth Century Fox cited Blu-ray Disc's adoption of the BD+ anticopying system as key to their decision to support the Blu-ray Disc format.
On January 4, 2008, a day before CES 2008, Warner Bros. (the only major studio still releasing movies in both HD screens.
In early 2010, Disney announced it would be putting out the DVD and Blu-ray versions of Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland 14 weeks after the movie's release date (instead of the then usual 17) in order to avoid competition from the 2010 World Cup. In response to such statements, theater owners made threats not to show the movie on their screens, but later reconsidered their position before the movie was released. Most major theater chains mandate an exclusivity window of 90 days before home video release, and 74-76 days before digital sell-through. 
Other strategies are also being deployed in order on January 25, 2005 by Senator Orrin Hatch (R - Utah), and was signed into law by President George W. Bush on April 27, 2005.
The act provides theater owners and employees with both civil and criminal immunity for questioning suspected violators or detaining them while police are summoned. Artist's Rights and Theft Prevention Act of 2005 This act, also known as the ""ART Act"", is targeted at preventing copyright infringement of movies and software. It specifically targets two activities: filming movies in a movie theater, and early release of movies and software before they become publicly available.
It permits preregistration of HD DVD from its inventory. Netflix and Blockbuster—major DVD rental companies—said they would no longer carry HD DVD.
Following these new developments, on February 19, 2008, Toshiba announced it would end production of HD DVD devices, allowing Blu-ray Disc to become the industry standard for high-density optical discs. Universal Studios, the sole major movie studio to back HD DVD since its inception, said shortly after Toshiba's announcement: ""While Universal values the close partnership we have shared with Toshiba, it is time to turn our focus to releasing new and catalog titles on Blu-ray Disc."" Paramount Pictures, which started releasing movies only had not released any high-definition discs, announced it would release exclusively on HD DVD. Explaining their decisions, the companies cited perceived advantages to HD DVD's technology and lower manufacturing costs. The companies together received about $150 million in cash and promotional guarantees, including a Toshiba HD DVD marketing campaign with a tie-in to Shrek the Third.
But retail support for HD DVD was eroding. In June 2007, Blockbuster, at the time the largest U.S. movie rental company, moved to Blu-ray exclusively in 1450 stores after test-marketing both formats at 250 stores and finding that more than 70% of high definition rentals from outtakes shot during the making of the third film and released in weekly installments on Joost from April 1 through June 13, 2011. The first trailer was originally released online on January 27, 2011 and the feature-length movie was released on Blu-ray and DVD on June 14, 2011, nearly a week before Ryan Dunn's death.

"joint defense agreement, for two months after Manafort had entered a plea and cooperation agreement with Mueller prosecutors. Although such joint defense agreements are not unusual or unlawful, they must be stopped if they create a conflict of interest, as it would be unethical for attorneys to collaborate when one of their clients is cooperating with prosecutors while another client is the subject of a continuing investigation. Legal experts noted that under joint defense privilege rules, once attorneys cease sharing a ""common interest"" of mutual defense, as in Manafort's case, attorney–client privilege is forfeited and the attorneys can be compelled  Further, they often do not have the budget to fully investigate the facts of a case through either staff or private investigators.  They often must rely solely on police reports for such information.  In some jurisdictions, clients do not meet their attorneys until they are in court.  Typically, public defenders will meet briefly with clients in holding facilities or jails.  The defense attorney defends his or her client by seeking less punishment.  Huemann (1977) indicates that many defense attorneys feel pressured to keep up with their caseloads.  This pressure can manifest in the percent.
Plaintiffs' lawyers generally are not concerned by such findings. Many plaintiffs' lawyers believe that focusing on solvent defendants is entirely appropriate given that they have a responsibility to maximize the compensation their clients receive. Many plaintiffs' attorneys also argued that defense lawyers had many ways to establish different theories of exposure. Theoretically, this could be done by examining ship logs, work histories, etc. They also note that all exposures are often identified if a case proceeds to verdict. There is usually no such full disclosure in settlements. Delayed filings and failure to disclose Plaintiffs attorneys routinely delay filing claims against stacking” is a process by which police and prosecutors create a case with numerous charges or numerous instances of the same charge to convince the defendant that the risk of not pleading guilty is intolerable.  The defendant may be convinced to plead guilty to a few of the charges in return for not being prosecuted for the remaining charges.
The courtroom workgroup is, in some sense, a response to a lack of resources for public defenders.  Defense attorneys in public defender offices often do not have sufficient time to prepare a case in detail for all of their clients. refusing to disclose information about the missing women. The committee explained that the attorneys would have violated their ethical obligations to keep their client's confidential information secret if they had disclosed the details to authorities.
The ethics opinion emphasized that the attorney-client privilege is necessary to ensure clients disclose all possible pertinent information to their lawyers. It further explained that disclosure of all possibly pertinent information allows attorneys to craft the strongest defense and protect their clients' rights to the fullest extent. Aftermath Although both lawyers were ultimately absolved of wrongdoing, the fallout took a toll on Armani and Belge. Belge between attorneys and clients. Dozens of attorney-client phone call were provided to other lawyers in the case. Robinson said it appeared the rights of some inmates had been violated. The FBOP forbids recording in attorney-client meeting rooms yet CoreCivic contends that silent video recordings of inmate-attorney meetings “are a standard practice” throughout the country and are used for prison security. In August 2016, Robinson ordered the recordings be halted. CoreCivic offered prisoners attorneys an option that such recordings be disabled for case conferences with their clients but a defense attorney informed the court that calls between himself and a client an affirmative duty to advise his client about it in accordance with the guarantees of the Sixth Amendment; and, (2) assuming deportation is a ""collateral consequence"", whether counsel's gross misadvice about deportation constitutes a ground for setting aside a guilty plea that is induced by that advice. Ultimately, the Court re-framed the case in a way that made the collateral consequences doctrine irrelevant. Decision The Supreme Court reversed the Kentucky Supreme Court's decision. The Supreme Court held that criminal defense attorneys are duty-bound to inform clients of the risk of deportation under three circumstances. Firstly, if the law is unambiguous, serious, prosecutors often can still bluff defense attorneys and their clients into pleading guilty to a lesser offense.
As a result, people who might have been acquitted because of lack of evidence, but also who are in fact truly innocent, will often plead guilty to the charge. Why? In a word, fear. And the more numerous and serious the charges, studies have shown, the greater the fear. That explains why prosecutors sometimes seem to file every charge imaginable against defendants.
The theoretical work based on the prisoner's dilemma is one reason why, in many countries, plea bargaining is forbidden. Often, precisely the Downing told the media that ""There is no evidence that Mr. Manafort or the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government.""
The New York Times reported on November 27, 2018, that Downing continued sharing information about Manafort's legal matters with Trump's attorneys, pursuant to a joint defense agreement, after Manafort had entered a plea and cooperation agreement with Mueller prosecutors. Although such joint defense agreements are not unusual or unlawful, they must be stopped if they create a conflict of interest, as it would be unethical for attorneys to collaborate when one of their clients is cooperating with prosecutors while another facility dogs are off duty, they are beloved pets that live with their primary handlers. Legal status Although prosecuting attorneys, law enforcement officers, and victim advocates support the use of courthouse facility dogs in assisting crime victims and witnesses while they testify in court, some defense attorneys object to their use out of concern that it is prejudicial to their clients.  The objection is usually based on the argument that the presence of the dog may make the prosecution witness more appealing to the jury.

Artificial casings Artificial casings are made of collagen (often derived from cattle skin), cellulose, or plastic. Artificial casings from animal collagen are generally edible, though some are not. Collagen casings Collagen casings are mainly produced from the collagen in beef or pig hides, and the bones and tendons. It can also be derived from poultry and fish. They have been made for more than 50 years and their share of the market has been increasing. Fish bone Fish bone is any bone of a fish. Fish bone also includes the bony, delicate parts of the skeleton of bony fish, such as ribs and fin rays, but especially the ossification of connective tissue lying transversely inclined backwards to the ribs between the muscle segments and having no contact with the spine.
Not all fish have fish bones in this sense; for instance, eels and anglerfish do not.
There are several series of fish bones: Epineuralia, Epicentralia, Epipleuralia and Myorhabdoi.
Fish bones support the core muscles without inhibiting their motility.
In cuisine, fish bones are usually removed and not eaten. Because activities on Shabbat; all are traced back to one of the 39 above principal melakhoth.
Given the above, the 39 melakhoth are not so much activities as ""categories of activity"". For example, while ""winnowing"" usually refers exclusively to the separation of chaff from grain, and ""selecting"" refers exclusively to the separation of debris from grain, they refer in the Talmudic sense to any separation of intermixed materials which renders edible that which was inedible. Thus, filtering undrinkable water to make it drinkable falls under this category, as does picking small bones from fish (gefilte fish is one solution to this problem). decades, numerous tetrapod fossils dating from the earliest Carboniferous have been found. Flora Flora include Lepidodendron, Calamites, Aneimites, Diplotnema, Carpolithus, Genselina. In addition, countless spores can be found. Fauna Fauna includes tetrapods, fish, arthropods (horseshoe crabs, trilobites and ostracods) and shells.  Fish material is quite common, but articulated bones are very rare.  Most common are scales, small ribs and teeth. Uncommon are larger bones including fin spines, jaws, cranial material, clavicles, limb bones and pelvic bones.
Arthropods include Paleolimulus woodae, an extinct horseshoe crab. Contrary to some erroneous reports in the popular press, it is not the world's oldest ripe fruit. Uses In Paraguay the fruit and palm hearts are eaten by local tribal communities (Ava Chiripá, Aché, others). The leaves are also used to make hats and other handicrafts.

The fruit are not considered edible in Argentina.
In Uruguay the single remaining, picturesque population has some ecotourism value.
This species is sometimes, be it rarely, cultivated (in Argentina, England, California). It is advised to plant the palms in full sunlight. It is said to Fish hydrolysate Fish hydrolysate, in its simplest form, is ground up fish transformed into a liquid phase, where the cleavage of molecular bonds occurs through various biological processes. Raw material choice; either whole fish or by-products, depends on the commercial sources of the fish. In some cases, the fillet portions are removed for human consumption, the remaining fish body (generally the guts, bones, cartilage, scales and remaining meat) is put into water and ground up. Some fish hydrolysate is ground more finely than others so more bone material is able to remain suspended. Enzymes may also be used to dissolve intended to raise edible fish because it is a warmwater fish species that can tolerate crowding and changing water conditions. Barramundi, silver perch, eel-tailed catfish or tandanus catfish, jade perch and Murray cod are also used. For temperate climates when there isn't ability or desire to maintain water temperature, bluegill and catfish are suitable fish species for home systems.
Koi and goldfish may also be used, if the fish in the system need not be edible.

Breitenbach's extensive use of humor in this work was a major departure from the mood of his early paintings, though social commentary is still present in Proverbidioms, for example in the sewer pipe running into the river, and the white female vs. black male representing ""I've got a bone to pick with you,"" a reference to both the women's and the civil rights movements. Breitenbach further maintains that much is revealed about man’s nature through the literal painting of his expressions. Therefore, the artist did not shy away from placing wise expressions such as ""Don't put I think if you do that, it does two things: It gets you some hits on radio, and it gives the listener a little variety."" 
In an interview with The Plain Dealer Walker said, ""Speaking of the `sophomore jinx,' I've got the `sophomore jitters.' I hope my second album does as well as the first album. I think I've progressed some as a singer and performer since the first one, but they (the buying public) have to like what's on the album itself if they're going to buy it."" He also stated, "" On the first album, I'd been writing asked me about the fact that Glastonbury hadn't sold out for the first time in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z. From there it grew into this crap that I was standing on an orange crate at Speakers' Corner saying, 'Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?' I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, ""Chicken sandwiches in McDonald's are just plain fucking wrong,"" it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've hung out with Jay-Z in Tokyo. I've seen his show. It's not my album Sing. The film opens with ""I've Got a Thing for You"" and closes with ""To Hell With the Devil."" During the film, ""Get On"" and the remix of ""I've Got a Thing for You"" are used. Name (Look Up the Number)' — probably my favourite Beatles' track!"" He went on to explain:
It's so insane. All the memories ... I mean, what would you do if a guy like John Lennon turned up at the studio and said, 'I've got a new song'. I said, 'What's the words?' and he replied 'You know my name look up the number'. I asked, 'What's the rest of it?' 'No, no other words, those are the words. And I want to do it like a mantra!'

"of a brain aneurysm.
Tetraplegic Matt Nagle became the first person to control an artificial hand using a BCI in 2005 as part of the first nine-month human trial of Cyberkinetics’s BrainGate chip-implant. Implanted in Nagle's right precentral gyrus (area of the motor cortex for arm movement), the 96-electrode BrainGate implant allowed Nagle to control a robotic arm by thinking about moving his hand as well as a computer cursor, lights and TV. One year later, professor Jonathan Wolpaw received the prize of the Altran Foundation for Innovation to develop a Brain Computer Interface with electrodes located on the surface of movements and thus controlled the game. After a while the monkey realised that thinking about moving the shape was enough and it no longer needed to move the joystick. So it let go of the joystick and controlled the game purely through thought. A system in which brain signals directly control an artificial actuator is commonly referred to as brain-machine interface or brain-computer interface.
On January 15, 2008, Dr. Nicolelis lab saw a monkey implanted with a new BCI successfully control a  robot walking on a treadmill in Kyoto, Japan.  The monkey could see the robot, named CB, on for conceptualizing motion. In the ego-moving metaphor, one progresses along a timeline toward the future, while in the time-moving metaphor, a timeline is conceived as a conveyor belt upon which events move from the future to the past like packages. (e.g. Lakoff 1987).
It appears that not only does thinking about actual motion influence people's judgments about time, but thinking about fictive motion has the same effect, suggesting that thinking about one abstract domain may influence people's understanding of another. This raises the question of whether the influence of fictive motion on people's understanding of time is rooted in a concrete, can flourish in the most astonishing of ways is extremely moving"". The Independent called it ""a radical and astonishing film that turns conventional thinking about immigrants on its head"". Representational momentum Representational momentum is a small, but reliable, error in our visual perception of moving objects.  Instead of knowing the exact location of a moving object, we actually think it is a bit further along its trajectory.  For example, people viewing an object moving from left to right that suddenly disappears will report they saw it a bit further to the right than where it actually vanished. While not a big error, it has been found in a variety of different events ranging from simple rotations  to camera movement through a scene.  The name ""representational Hering illusion looks like bicycle spokes around a central point, with vertical lines on either side of this central, so-called vanishing point.
The illusion tricks us into thinking we are looking at a perspective picture, and thus according to Changizi, switches on our future-seeing abilities. Since we aren't actually moving and the figure is static, we misperceive the straight lines as curved ones.
Changizi said:
Evolution has seen to it that geometric drawings like this elicit in us premonitions of the near future. The converging lines toward a vanishing point (the spokes) are cues that trick our brains into thinking we are moving a unique pattern can be seen in the brains of two people interacting and that these brain activities distinguish independence from cooperation. This new brain rhythm that we have discovered and termed the 'phi complex' actually distinguishes when you're socially interacting and when you're not."" Informer's Matt Helgeson, who gave the game a 3.0 out of a possible 10, ""If I'm going to spend a long period of time with my hand wrapped around an oblong object, moving my arm rapidly up and down, it sure won't be with this game.""

"Chew and spit Chew and Spit (CHSP or CS) is a compensatory behavior associated with several eating disorders that involves the chewing of food and spitting it out before swallowing, often as an attempt to avoid ingestion of unwanted or unnecessary calories. CS can be used as a way to taste food viewed as “forbidden” or unhealthy. Individuals who partake in CS typically have an increased desire for thinness, increased lack of control (LOC) and body dissatisfaction. CS can serve different functions such as replacing vomiting and/or binging or as an additional behavior to many eating disorders.

We didn't intend on it being a single. We put that song out for our fans as a taste and get them involved in helping us make a lyric video for it. We put it out on our own and we didn't really serve it to radio until radio started to call us and then we started sending it to 'em. It just kinda got a head of steam and started rolling so it was way cool. Very cool and very proud of that in the court. After the song ends, Curly slaps Moe on the back and makes him swallow his harmonica, briefly turning him into a musical instrument that Larry and Curly comically play a song with before Curly helps Moe spit the harmonica back out. Curly is then seen chewing gum and sternly told by the judge to get rid of it. He throws it away, but it accidentally lands on Moe's face. Larry then takes a napkin and  removes the gum, twisting Moe's nose in pain. Larry then stomps on it and bellows out in a loud exaggerated Tarzan ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" and Stevie Wonder's ""Superstition"". Thomas recalled, ""[Producer] Nick Lowe was standing by the drums while we were trying things out and said, 'What about something like 'Satisfaction″—that Devo thing. And I probably did something, and Nick said, 'Do the snare there, the hi-hat there...' and then I had to make sense of it. It’s 'Satisfaction' by Devo into 'Superstition', and it doesn't sound anything like either"". Release and reception ""New Lace Sleeves"" was released on Costello's fifth album, Trust, in 1981. The song was not released as a single. Since its initial release, ""New Lace normal people that get put on TV and stuff. That is just who we are… so if that makes us famous like the E!

She directed the radio audience to the value of the texture experience in food and the connection it has in the overall satisfaction of the consumer.  In conclusion, she suggested Ulrich said:
"" '[Spit Out the Bone]' was just an adventure, man. I have versions of that song that are two to three minutes longer. We just kept going and going and going. That was also the first song where we went, 'Wait a minute, is there too much of a good thing here?' And then we started peeling it back.

Gafurov consistently pursued the idea that an ""absence of taste"" and ""bad taste"" are fundamentally different things. Bad taste according to Gafurov is ""love for Haydn and no love for Brahms"". Absence of taste is to be ""more likely to listen to popular singers than good symphonic orchestra.""
Gafurov understands ethics only as narrative, ""positive, rather than normative"": ""... Ethics and behavior are subject to the same laws.

Today, things are different and Bad Taste has first rights to the next album of any artist they produce, although they give full artistic freedom.
Other Bad Taste projects was to include a radio station called Skratti (“Devil”), a restaurant called Drullupytturinn (“The Mud Pit”), but neither of these became reality. A record store named after for a solo consisting of ""metallic, two-hand tapping on electric guitar"", combining the two styles and ending with a separate ""spacier"" electronic segment. The solo elements were described playfully as ""impossible, ridiculous Yngwie guitar arpeggios"", which reflect the fast arpeggiation common with violin parts in classical music. Bangalter acknowledged that ""Some people might think that the guitar solos on 'Aerodynamic' are in bad taste, but for us, it's all about being true to ourselves and not caring what other people would think. We really tried to include most of the things we liked as kids, and bring that sense of Taste of Cherry is ""only"" a movie, this wonderful ending is saying, among other things, that it’s also a movie. And we don’t have to remember all of the lyrics of ""St. James Infirmary"" to know that death is waiting for us around the corner.""
The Criterion Collection entered Taste of Cherry into their exclusive film collection on June 1, 1999. Since the film's release, multiple other critics have also declared it a masterpiece; in the British Film Institute's 2012 Sight & Sound poll, six critics and two directors named Taste of Cherry one of the 10 best films ever made. Rules (novel) Themes 1. People have good intentions to live by the rules they are given, but no matter how dedicated they are, some rules might be broken for reasons good or bad.
2. There are flaws in all of us – not just those with special needs.
3. We all try to do the best we can to fit in, but things don’t always end up the way we intend.
4. Always stick with family no matter what.
5. Even the best of us can't stick to their own rules. Inspiration Lord has two children, a son, and a daughter, and was inspired they are also intended to hurt. People hurt and insult one another because, we sense, attack is the best form of defense inside this carnivorous society. Some of the dialog is in appallingly bad taste, and some of the critics have blamed the bad taste on Preminger, but it would have taken a lesser director to leave it out. The vulgarity belongs there because the movie is as tough as the people it's about.""
Time said, ""The whole notion is so outrageously melodramatic that Preminger was probably right in choosing to play it for comedy . . . On second thought, we don't hate anybody. And there are things we love that we're going to have sometimes if the breaks are not too bad against us. Way down under this latest hit of his, Irving Berlin catches us where we love peace.""
""White Christmas"" won Berlin the Academy Award for Best Music in an Original Song, one of seven Oscar nominations he received during his career.

An actor's age and physique affects the quality of movies. Scary-looking actors are suited for horror roles. Younger, more handsome looking actors are more suited for romance movie roles. 30-year-old actors are suited for action roles, and older actors are suited for comedy roles. All actors and directors will retire at age 70. However, depending on a Star's experience in the movie's genre, the movie's quality will go up time in Russia, surpassing Stalingrad with 1.68 billion rubles ($28.8 million) Budget The exact budget for the movie is unknown but it's estimated to be somewhere between $6 and $8 million. In 2017 production company Yellow, Black and White (YBW) revealed that the overall production and promotion budget was 370 million Russian Rubles (~$8 million), equally distributed between Disney and YBW. The film is partially sponsored by Russian government through Fond kino, which gave 100 million Russian Rubles to YBW, although half of that sum was returned to state-owned Fond kino thanks to the movie's commercial success. Sequel The Russian as long as budget will allow (although a 10-minute film might require over 20 game years of filming). In sandbox mode however, a director can have the movie shoot automatically with the correct options turned on, allowing a 15–20 minute movie made in about a minute. If this is chosen, however, the movie's crew rating will be announced as ""awful"". Once the actors, extras, director and crew are assigned to a film, production begins, with the entire staff of the film travelling between sets to film the movie. The sandbox mode allows films to be created without undergoing the lengthy run out of money. Frank contemplates suicide, but Loyd talks him out of it by reminding him of his family and their friendship. Production Sutherland and Pennell raised $43,000 for production of the movie. Estimates for the actual cost of the movie are less than $30,000 as Pennell used part of the movie's budget for his living expenses. Rehearsals began in September 1977 and filming started in early October. The film was shot on location in Austin, Texas. Production wrapped in December 1977 and Pennell started entering the movie in film festivals in 1978.

When her agent called up the movie's producer to request if she could be paid more, she was told ""Go to hell. Be my guest — ask for more money. We don’t even want her in this movie.” Huston, who was not only John Huston's daughter but also Jack Nicholson's days of the production, actual shooting was extremely limited due to near-constant rain which caused severe flooding in the areas they had planned to shoot. Hellman estimated that $5,000 of the already small budget was eaten up by the wasted time. Another $10,000 of the budget was for the horse wranglers' salaries, the only union element of the film, apart from the actors. Corman's deal with Hellman and Nicholson was that if the film went over budget, any additional costs would come out of their own pockets. Despite the initial problems, the film was completed for the original budget estimate.
Because exhilarating comedy in years. Anyone who says otherwise must be conning you.""
Peter Debruge of Variety was critical of the film, calling it ""a sloppy sprawl of a movie"" and complaining that the improvisational performances overwhelm, instead of adding to a coherent plot. He also went on to write that it ""makes your brain hurt — and worse, overwhelms the already over-complicated Abscam re-telling at the center of the film"". Box office Variety estimated the production budget at $40 million. When producer Charles Roven was asked if the budget was in the $40 to $50 million area, he responded: ""I'd say Church that involved several police officers in uniform.
In order to enhance the quality of the film, the production crew is using a new camera technology, ""Red One"", by the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company. Kendrick estimated the production budget would exceed $1 million — double that of Fireproof. The final budget has been reported at $2 million.

"patterns found on Earth: on islands, continents, and even among mountains.
Islands are often home to species endemics—existing only on an island and nowhere else in the world—with nearly all taxa residing on isolated islands sharing common ancestry with a species on the nearest continent. Not without challenge, there is typically a correlation between island endemics and diversity; that is, that the greater the diversity (species richness) of an island, the greater the increase in endemism. Increased diversity effectively drives speciation. Furthermore, the number of endemics on an island is directly correlated with the relative isolation of the island and its spawning grounds of the giant cuttlefish off New South Wales. They nest on ridges, slopes, or plateaus, and will build their nest in the open or within patchy vegetation, such as tussock grassland.

It is located south of Dean Channel and about 20 kilometres (12 mi) east of Bella Bella. A number of other islands separate King Island from the open sea of Queen Charlotte Sound.
King Island is separated from the mainland by Dean Channel to the north, Burke Channel to the south, and Labouchere Channel to the east. Fisher Channel, essentially an extension of Dean Channel, separates King Island from several islands to the west, including Denny Island and Hunter Island.

The New York Times editorial board wrote in December 2009: ""If we have learned anything over the last couple of years, it is that banks that are too big to fail pose too much of a risk to the economy. Any serious effort to reform the financial system must ensure that no such banks exist.""

United Kingdom The previous British Chancellor (finance minister) George Osborne has threatened to break up banks which are too big to fail.
The too-big-to-fail idea has led to legislators and governments facing the challenge of limiting the scope of these hugely important organisations, and regulating activities perceived as risky or speculative—to achieve this regulation in the UK, banks are advised to follow the UK's Independent regulators were willing to let the bank fail to reduce moral hazard and so other banks would rein in some of their more risky lending practices. Members of Congress and the press, however, felt that Continental Illinois was ""too big to fail"". In May 1984, federal banking regulators finally offered a $4.5 billion rescue package to Continental Illinois.
Continental Illinois itself may not have been too big to fail, but its collapse could have caused the failure of some of the largest banks. The American banking system had been significantly weakened by the severe recession and the effects of deregulation. Had McColl blunted opposition to the bank mergers and acquisitions by pledging in advance billion in loans for low-income neighborhoods, particularly with the creation of NationsBank and Bank of America. Effect of McColl's merger strategy on financial crisis of 2007–2008 During the financial crisis of 2007-2008, after McColl's retirement, Bank of America was dubbed ""too big to fail"" and received $45 billion in federal government funds. In a 2012 article for Rolling Stone titled Bank of America: Too Crooked to Fail, author Matt Taibbi attributed factors at Bank of America leading up to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 directly to McColl's Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan hinted at support for the idea behind the amendment with his statement that ""If they’re too big to fail, they're too big."" Related legislation was passed in the Bank Holding Act of 1970, which gave regulatory powers to the Federal Reserve to cap bank sizes, but it was weakly enforced. A previous (1994) law limited a bank's total deposits to less than 10% of the nation's total, but waivers were issued to JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America.
The amendment would have capped deposits and other liabilities and restricted bank assets to 10% of Too big to fail The ""too big to (let) fail"" theory asserts that certain corporations, particularly financial institutions, are so large and so interconnected that their failure would be disastrous to the greater economic system, and that they therefore must be supported by government when they face potential failure. The colloquial term ""too big to fail"" was popularized by U.S. Congressman Stewart McKinney in a 1984 Congressional hearing, discussing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's intervention with Continental Illinois. The term had previously been used occasionally in the press.

Therefore, banks optimally take on more risk because it does not care about the losses that occur in those states of nature when it goes bankrupt. Creditors will be bailed out and the interest rate at which the bank can borrow is therefore insensitive to bankruptcy risk.

"Obama signed, the USA Freedom Act which restored in modified form several provisions of the Patriot Act that had expired the day before, while for the first time imposing some limits on the bulk collection of telecommunication data on U.S. citizens by American intelligence agencies. The new restrictions were widely seen as stemming from Snowden's revelations. Europe Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Germany's domestic security agency, said that Snowden could have been working for the Russian government. Snowden has rejected this insinuation. International community Crediting the Snowden leaks, the United Nations General a patriot, and in November said that ""the benefit of the debate he generated was not worth the damage done, because there was another way of doing it.""
In June 2013, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont wrote on his blog, ""Love him or hate him, we all owe Snowden our thanks for forcing upon the nation an important debate. But the debate shouldn't be about him. It should be about the gnawing questions his actions raised from the shadows.""
Snowden said in December 2013 that he was ""inspired by the global debate"" ignited by the leaks and that NSA's ""culture of FBI–Apple encryption dispute The FBI–Apple encryption dispute concerns whether and to what extent courts in the United States can compel manufacturers to assist in unlocking cell phones whose data are cryptographically protected. There is much debate over public access to strong encryption.
In 2015 and 2016, Apple Inc. received and objected to or challenged at least 11 orders issued by United States district courts under the All Writs Act of 1789. Most of these seek to compel Apple ""to use its existing capabilities to extract data like contacts, photos and calls from locked iPhones running on operating systems iOS 7 and prioritize finding (or even creating) and keeping vulnerabilities secret. Bruce Schneier has called for the NSA to be broken up so that the group charged with strengthening cryptography is not subservient to the groups that want to break the cryptography of its targets. Encryption of smartphone storage As part of the Snowden leaks, it became widely known that intelligence agencies could bypass encryption of data stored on Android and iOS smartphones by legally ordering Google and Apple to bypass the encryption on specific phones. Around 2014, as a reaction to this, Google and Apple redesigned their encryption so that they the industry has been received critically by certain government actors, the FBI in particular. This led to the widely reported FBI–Apple encryption dispute over the possibility to gain access to information on the iPhone in assistance to law enforcement. In 2016, several bills were introduced in the US Congress that would place new limits encryption under USA law. The USA's legal system promotes and requires security measures to be implemented in the relevant contexts, including cryptographic methods of various kinds, to ensure security in commerce and trade. Relevant laws are the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014, the Canada, Australia and New Zealand as ""UKUSA-collaborating Commonwealth countries"". Other countries that joined as ""third parties"" were Norway (1952), Denmark (1954) and West Germany (1955). Recent media leaks In July 2013, as part of the 2013 Edward Snowden revelations, it emerged that the NSA is paying GCHQ for its services, with at least £100 million of payments made between 2010 and 2013.
On 11 September 2013, The Guardian released a leaked document provided by Edward Snowden which reveals a similar agreement between the NSA and Israel's Unit 8200.
According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Australia operates clandestine surveillance facilities at its embassies Snowden in 2013. The decision voided U.S. District Judge William Pauley's December 2013 finding that the NSA program was lawful, and remanded the case to him for further review. The appeals court did not rule on the constitutionality of the bulk surveillance, and declined to enjoin the program, noting the pending expiration of relevant parts of the Patriot Act. Circuit Judge Gerard E. Lynch wrote that, given the national security interests at stake, it was prudent to give Congress an opportunity to debate and decide the matter. USA Freedom Act On June 2, 2015, the U.S. Senate passed, and President List (CCL), administered by the Department of Commerce. The USA Department of Commerce maintains some controls over items on the CCL, including registration, technical reviews and reporting obligations, and continues to impose licensing and other requirements for sensitive encryption items and sales of such items to foreign governments.
The debate ignited after the Edward Snowden revelations and the well-documented increase in deployed encryption measures by Internet services, device makers and users, as well as a concerted call from the technical community and civil society to increase encryption use and security to address mass surveillance practices. The increased adoption of encryption by Awards received by Edward Snowden Recognition Edward Snowden was voted as The Guardian's person of the year 2013, garnering four times the number of votes than any other candidate.
The 2013 list of leading Global Thinkers, published annually by Foreign Policy placed Snowden in first place due to the impact of his revelations. FP's ""Global Conversation visualization"" showed that Snowden ""occupied a role in 2013's global news media coverage just slightly less important than President Barack Obama himself.""

The three biggest impacts were seen as increased interest in encryption, business leaving U.S. companies, and a reconsideration of the safety of cloud technology.

Range-extended electric hybrid vehicles Jaguar Land Rover displayed the ultra-low carbon XJ_e plug-in hybrid engineering research vehicle at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in June 2012. This was the outcome of a total energy density closely competing with lithium-ion batteries. The new cell have a potential energy density of 596 Ah kg−1, which is higher than lithium-ion batteries. If these fuel cells are proven, they could be used as soon as three years from now. These fuel cells can be used to power a cell phone for ten days, unlike the current lithium-ion batteries that can only be used for one day. 
Sony was also able to successfully develop a sugar-based biofuel cell that does not require mixing or convection of the glucose solution or air movement. This was achieved through a passive-type manufacturers, where the most efficient chargers consume less than 0.03 watts and obtain a five-star rating.
Get to know about the best and fastest phone chargers. Battery A popular early mobile phone battery was the nickel metal-hydride (NiMH) type, due to its relatively small size and low weight. Lithium ion batteries are also used, as they are lighter and do not have the voltage depression due to long-term over-charging that nickel metal-hydride batteries do. Many mobile phone manufacturers use lithium–polymer batteries as opposed to the older lithium-ion, the main advantages being even lower weight and the possibility to make the battery cycles than a typical lithium-ion battery. In addition, recharging via CHAdeMO takes much less time than charging at the AC Level 2 rate used by most electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), allowing the SCiB battery to reach 80% capacity in 15 minutes, 50% in 10 minutes and 25% in 5 minutes. 
The SCiB battery offers a higher effective capacity than a typical lithium-ion battery, which combined with more efficient regenerative charging during braking or coasting downhill, allows the SCiB battery to deliver 1.7 times the driving range per charge of a typical lithium-ion battery of the same size. Alternatively, the A small prototype battery cell has been developed that can fully charge in 10 to 20 seconds, compared with six minutes for standard battery cells.
Negative electrodes (anode, on discharge) made of petroleum coke were used in early lithium-ion batteries; later types used natural or synthetic graphite. Advantages and disadvantages The LiFePO
₄ battery uses a lithium-ion-derived chemistry and shares many advantages and disadvantages with other lithium-ion battery chemistries. However, there are significant differences.
LFP chemistry offers a longer cycle life than other lithium-ion approaches.
Like nickel-based rechargeable batteries (and unlike other lithium ion batteries), LiFePO
₄ batteries have a very constant discharge voltage. Voltage CR-V3 battery Disposable CR-V3 batteries Often, a CR-V3 battery is a single cell based on a non-rechargeable lithium battery chemistry, with a nominal voltage of 3 V (the same as 2 alkaline AA batteries).  Because both lithium and lithium-ion chemistries offer higher energy density than NiMH rechargeable batteries or even alkaline batteries, a CR-V3 battery is designed to last much longer than a pair of AA batteries.
  Some more recent CR-V3 batteries are composed of 2 lithium AA batteries. Rechargeable RCR-V3 batteries Rechargeable lithium-ion RCR-V3 batteries, with a nominal voltage of 3.7 V, are also available. Some have a but higher in Ampere-Hours capacity than the older 12-cell battery, reflecting advances in battery manufacture over years.  The battery remains NiMh compared to the Lithium battery used in Germany (and avoiding all hazard concerns with Lithium Ion batteries). However, the new Botvac Connected has a lithium battery. The BotVac is sold in several packages differing in accessories included such as extra filters and different brush types, same as the previous XV models were packaged.
As of 2017, Neato Robotics has 15 models on the market: the original XV-11 (green), the European and Malaysian XV-15 (blue), the XV-12 (white) and the the battery.
However, it should be understood that the concept of a float voltage does not apply equally to all battery chemistries.  For instance, lithium ion cells have to be float charged with extra care because if they are float charged at just a little over optimum voltage, which is generally the full output voltage of the lithium cell, the chemical system within the cell will be damaged to some extent.  Some lithium ion variants are less tolerant than others, but generally overheating, which shortens cell life is likely, and fire and explosion possible other outcomes. It is important been used.
A high cut-off voltage is more widespread than perhaps assumed. For example, a certain brand of mobile phone that is powered with a single-cell Lithium-ion battery cuts off at 3.3V. The Li‑ion can be discharged to 3V and lower; however, with a discharge to 3.3V (at room temperature), about 92–98% of the capacity is used.
Importantly, particularly in the case of lithium ion batteries which are used in the vast majority of portable electronics today, a voltage cut-off below 3.2V can lead to chemical instability in the cell, with the result being a reduced battery lifetime.
